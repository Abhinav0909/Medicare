# MediCare

## 💡 Inspiration

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

There is no easy way to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. However, there are some things that can be done to help diagnose the disease. Neurological tests are much better ways to diagnose the disease. MoCA(Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a gold standard test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.

## 💻 What it does

MediCare is a web application where users can take a Parkinson's test to check if they have Parkinson's or not. We also have a storytelling game, especially for elderly people to diagnose Alzheimer's and improve cognitive skills. The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people to find the right medical care/supervision for themselves.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Firebase: For backend
- Firestore: For database
- Tensorflow.s: For ML and disease prediction
- Google Teachable Machine: For training the model
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 📚 Research

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As I don't have any experience with ML, I learned how to use Tensorflow.js to build the ML model.
- It was the first time I used the Google Teachable Machine so I had to learn how to use it.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project in the given time frame.
- Using the Google Teachable Machine to train the model.
- Using Tensorflow.js to build the ML model.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to use Google teachable machine to predict the disease.
- How to use Tensorflow.js to build the ML model.

## 🚀 What's next for MediCare

- Building a mobile app
- Deploying the web app.
- Improving the accuracy of the model.
